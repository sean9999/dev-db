# Dev DB

This project is for working with local copies of HRD databases:

- The "ext" database
- The conf database
- Redis

It makes it easy to pull down data so your local db is like the remote.

It should be part of an effort to make every go service is to run locally be doing this:

```sh
$ go run .
```
